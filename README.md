#What is this?#
320andup_joomla is a port of the awesome 320andup from Andy Clarke, http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/ , to Joomla 1.7+. This fork creates a template package that will install to Joomla like any other template.

#Yeah, but what is it?#
320andup is a mobile-first boilerplate that allows you to build responsive web pages the smart way ;) All credit should go to Andy @malarkey for pretty much everything in this repository. All I have done is add some Joomla required code, a templateDetails.xml file so that it installs to Joomla and fixed up some file paths so they are Joomla! friendly.

#Say whut?#
320andup starts with a tiny screen stylesheet that contains only reset, colour and typography styles. Media Queries then load assets and layout styles progressively and only as they’re needed.

#I'm lost#
Look, if you want to build a responsive, mobile-first tempate for Joomla 1.7+ this is the best starting point there is. 

Pick a version, multiple or single stylesheets, .zip the files in that folder and you have a Joomla! template. Simples. Want more than the handful of positions included? You will have to learn how to use copy and paste....
