# Responsive web design boilerplate.

Please note, this project’s no longer maintained.

A lot’s changed since <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/320_and_up/"> we wrote the original ‘320 and Up’</a>, our ‘tiny screen first’ responsive web design boilerplate. Back then we were just getting started with responsive web design and many sites, including ours, and frameworks and boilerplates like HTML5 Boilerplate, structured their CSS3 Media Queries from the desktop down, rather than for small screens up. Oh how we laughed when we realised our mistake.

To put things right, we wrote the original ‘320 and Up’. It worked as an extension to <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> or a set of standalone files. ‘320 and Up’ was been used by designers and developers all over the web.
